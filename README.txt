Release v0.1 at 2015-10-27
Created by Varymicus for /tg/
Based on the MGCYOA-QB2 PDF by Quasar Black with contributing material from Anonymous and Boss.

--VERSION HISTORY--

--PREFACE--
Heya, /tg/. This is just a quick web mockup of the PDF. There are some likely better interactive versions in Python and C#; check the thread OPs.

--INSTRUCTIONS--
The interface should be pretty intuitive, but there are a couple of points I'd like to highlight anyway:
- The number of your remaining coins are shown in the bottom right.
- You can hide or show a section by clicking on the title.

--REQUIREMENTS--
A modern browser is recommended.
This site makes use of JavaScript and CSS.
Browser compatibility is not guaranteed (yet - sorry!). Use at your own risk.
This site should function at most resolutions.
